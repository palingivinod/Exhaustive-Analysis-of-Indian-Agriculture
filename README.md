In the Process of  Power BI analysis on the Indian agriculture sector, till i learnt the following:

1. Data Connection & Preprocessing
   - Learned how to   import CSV data   into Power BI and clean it using   Power Query Editor (PQE)  .
   - Understood how to   handle missing values   (changing `null` values to `0`).
   - Gained experience in   renaming columns   for better readability.
   - Understood the importance of   removing unnecessary columns   (e.g., `S.No`) to optimize the dataset.

2. Data Exploration & Understanding
   - Examined dataset structure:   7 columns and 73,827 rows  .
   - Analyzed   data types   for accuracy in calculations and visualizations.

3. Data Visualization Techniques
   -   Slicers for Filtering  : Created slicers for `State Name`, `Crop Name`, and `Year` to allow dynamic filtering of visualizations.
   -   Stacked Bar Chart  : Identified the   Top 5 crops   based on production.
   -   Funnel Chart  : Found the   Top 3 states   by production.
   -   Pie Chart  : Discovered the   Top 3 districts   in terms of production.
   -   Tree Map  : Explored   production trends by crop year  .
   -   Line Chart  : Attempted to   predict production trends   for the next year.
   -   Donut Chart  : Analyzed   seasonal variations   in crop production.

4. Key Insights & Predictive Analysis
   - Understood   how to rank data (e.g., filtering top crops, states, and districts).
   - Explored   seasonal trends   in production.
   - Learned to use   line charts   for making simple production predictions.
